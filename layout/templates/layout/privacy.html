                                We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. You may ask to have the

                                In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some

                                At our Site you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current
                                industry standards. We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
                                unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your
                                PII. For example:
                                We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete and
                                current. We encrypt all PII, in order to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such
                                information when it is transmitted to us. We also only keep collected information
                                indefinitely and use it only for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply
                                with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.

                                We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and agents who have a
                                reasonable need to come into contact with your information. For example, we may provide
                                members of our technical support team with limited access to your account in order to
                                allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site. These individuals
                                are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including
                                termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

                                Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique customer
                                ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge
                                your password to anyone.
